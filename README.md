# known-shortprofile

A [Known](http://withknown.com) plugin to clean up the URLs displayed in the profile page. 

## What does it do?

When you setup Known, enter some URLs in your profile and then have a look at your profile page it somehow looks like this:

![Without Plugin](https://egoexpress.github.io/known-shortprofile/images/without-plugin.png)

Wow, all those long URLs kinda mess up the overview. Here's where this plugin comes in. It shortens the URLs down to the respective 
usernames (if applicable) and even adds some more icons for the different profiles.
So, after activating the plugin the profile shown above looks like this:

![With Plugin](https://egoexpress.github.io/known-shortprofile/images/with-plugin.png)

Neat, huh?

## Looks awesome, how do I set it up?

Easy. Just switch to the _IdnoPlugins_ directory of your Known installation and checkout this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/egoexpress/known-shortprofle.git ShortProfile
    
Afterwards, activate the plugin and off you go.
